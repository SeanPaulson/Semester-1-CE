# Semester-1-CE
This repo documents my first-semester self-study in Computer Engineering and Math. It tracks weekly progress in Discrete Math, Algebra 2, Trigonometry, and Robotics Labs, with notes, exercises, certifications, and reviews to build a portfolio before UCCS in May 2026.

# 🎓 Introduction

Hi, my name is Sean. This repository documents my self-study journey in **Computer Engineering and Mathematics** as I prepare to enroll at **UCCS by May 2026**.  

My goal is to build a strong academic foundation before starting college, using official textbooks, robotics kits, and structured study plans that mirror real university curricula. By organizing my progress here, I can stay accountable, track my learning week by week, and create a portfolio that demonstrates both discipline and technical growth.  

I’m posting everything publicly on GitHub because:
- ✅ Transparency: Sharing my notes, labs, and progress shows the effort behind my learning.  
- ✅ Portfolio: Future professors, employers, or collaborators can see my skills in action.  
- ✅ Accountability: Weekly commits keep me consistent and motivated.  
- ✅ Community: Others studying similar subjects can learn from my summaries, labs, and resources.  

This repo is not just a record of what I’ve studied — it’s a **living syllabus** that grows with me. By the end of this semester, I’ll have completed Discrete Math, Algebra 2, Trigonometry, and Robotics Labs, with certifications and summaries to prove my progress.
